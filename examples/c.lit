# An scratchpad of C code.

First, evaluate this in Emacs so that the code block mode is set to c.

---
(setq lit-mode-code-block-mode 'c-mode)
---

Then use the shortcut "C-;" with the cursor inside the block below to narrow the buffer to the block and get C syntax highlighting.

--- /main.c
#include <stdio>

int main() {
    printf("The downside of this is LSP errors.\n");
    printf("Even though we narrowed, our LSP server reads the entire file.\n");
}
